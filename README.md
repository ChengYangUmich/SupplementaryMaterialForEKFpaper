**ABSTRACT**
Grey-box models, which combine the explanatory power of first-principle models with the ability to detect subtle patterns from data, are
gaining increasing attention in wastewater sectors. Intuitive, simple structured but fit-for-purpose grey-box models that capture time-varying
dynamics by adaptively estimating parameters are desired for process optimization and control. As an example, this study presents the
identification of such a grey-box model structure and its further use by an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF), for the estimation of the nitrification
capacity and ammonia concentrations of a typical Modified Ludzack-Ettinger (MLE) process. The EKF was implemented and evaluated in real
time by interfacing Python with SUMO (Dynamitaâ„¢), a widely used commercial process simulator. The EKF was able to accurately estimate
the ammonia concentrations in multiple tanks when given only the concentration in one of them. Besides, the nitrification capacity of the
system could be tracked in real time by the EKF, which provides intuitive information for facility managers and operators to monitor and
operate the system. Finally, the realization of EKF is critical to the development of future advance control, for instance, model predictive
control. Q3
